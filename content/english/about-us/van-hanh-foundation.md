The specific purpose of this corporation is to educate the public about Buddhism, Buddhist philosophies, and Buddhist teachings. We hope to instill a sense of harmony and concord for the local Buddhist community. In addition, this corporation aims to enrich the lives of Vietnamese-American youth by immersing them in the Vietnamese language and culture. Doing so provides them with the opportunity to learn their native language, discuss and explore the history of Vietnam, and engage in traditional practices amongst fellow peers. The objective is to provide youth with a safe space to foster their personal growth and leadership development. Furthermore, this corporation serves as a Community Service Center and Senior Service Center. Citizens have the opportunity to build connections, volunteer their time, and participate in events created for the local community.
