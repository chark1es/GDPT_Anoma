The primary objective of Vạn Hạnh and Anôma is to promote Buddhist education and foster a sense of harmony within the local Buddhist community. Our mission also involves enriching the lives of Vietnamese-American youth by immersing them in their native language and culture. By providing a platform for learning Vietnamese, discussing Vietnam's history, and engaging in traditional practices alongside their peers, we create a safe space for personal growth and leadership development among the youth. Our aim is to empower these young individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to embrace their heritage and contribute positively to society.
